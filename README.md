# ChernobylTours
This is an android application which belongs to [SoloEast](https://www.tourkiev.com/) travel company to help their customer navigate in exclusion zone while taking a trip with a tour guide.

It supports five different localization both in text and audio formats, so you can make the trip as if you were with a guide-person
but no leaving your room in Japanese, Chinese, French, German or English langauges and later, visit zone by yourself!

You can also check website in application and book some tour!

Really hope, you will enjoy this application and leave positive feedback for me as a developer and creator of this software!
